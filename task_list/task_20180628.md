## 标题:  如何安全的存储委员会列表


* 任务描述:
 
In a hybrid consensus, security wise, the most important step is to maintain privately a list of private chain members and keep it secure. For if the list is sniffed off in an MITM attack, it could be DDoS'ed. How can we ensure, a list of newly elected members in a private chain to be shared securely over the network. ?

Can there be a signature based crypto algorithm used to unpack this list, only by the target nodes meant to receive it? Could zero knowledge proof concept be applied to network list separately?
