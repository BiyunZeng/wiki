# TrueChain Developer Guide

TrueChain is a truly fast, permissionless, secure and scalable permissionless blockchain platform which is supported by hybrid consensus technology called Minerva and a global developer community.

TrueChain MainNet is planned to be launched in Sep. 2018 (only to priority node). After TrueChain MainNet release, we would like to welcome new developers to the TrueChain technical community, so this tutorial and the Developer Center (you will find the link from this tutorial) are prepared to help developers famialirize themsevles with TrueChain development in a quick manner.
